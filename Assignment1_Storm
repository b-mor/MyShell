Operating Systems - Assignment 1: Storm

TODO:
    1. Always prompt "MyShell> " to the user on every line.
        - Do this as part of Main
        - Could use a while loop to continually display.
            * While (input != 'exit') {
                stuff here
            }
        - Create a pointer to a string of "MyShell> " as a global variable.
          Continually reference this string as part of the recurring prompt.

    2. Parse input from user.
        - Many different ways to accept user input. Research and find the safest
          way to do so.
        - Need to malloc and save the user input as a string to be passed on
          to the system when calling user commands.
        - BONUS: Accept any length of user input.
            * Iterate through user input until we find the first occurrence
              of a null terminator (ASCII 0?).
            * Use a counter that increments by 1 for every char until the
              null terminator. This is the length of the user input.
            * Use the calculated length to malloc an appropriate size string
              for saving user input to be executed.

    3. Execute command from user input
        - Fork a child process using the user input.
        - Wait until the command terminates.
        - Return to the main prompt and repeat the cycle.


Task List:
	- Continually display "MyShell> " and await user input
	- Save user input
	- Feed input to the OS

Sequence:

	1. Print prompt. XXX
	2. Wait for user input. XXX
	3. Accept user input.
	4. Evaluate input.
	5. Execute input.
